s3fs
====

s3fs allows Linux and Mac OS X to mount an S3 bucket via FUSE.
s3fs preserves the native object format for files, allowing use of other tools like [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd).  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)

Features
--------

* large subset of POSIX including reading/writing files, directories, symlinks, mode, uid/gid, and extended attributes
* compatible with Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and other S3-based object stores
* large files via multi-part upload
* renames via server-side copy
* optional server-side encryption
* data integrity via MD5 hashes
* in-memory metadata caching
* local disk data caching
* user-specified regions, including Amazon GovCloud
* authenticate via v2 or v4 signatures

Installation
------------

Some systems provide pre-built packages:

* On Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04 or newer:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install s3fs
  ```

* On SUSE 12 or newer and openSUSE 42.1 or newer:

  ```
  sudo zypper in s3fs
  ```

* On Mac OS X, install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

  ```ShellSession
  $ brew cask install osxfuse
  $ brew install s3fs
  ```

Compilation
-----------

* On Linux, ensure you have all the dependencies:

On Ubuntu 14.04:

```
sudo apt-get install automake autotools-dev fuse g++ git libcurl4-openssl-dev libfuse-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pkg-config
```

On CentOS 7:

```
sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel
```

Then compile from master via the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
cd s3fs-fuse
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Examples
--------

The default location for the s3fs password file can be created:

* using a .passwd-s3fs file in the users home directory (i.e. ~/.passwd-s3fs)
* using the system-wide /etc/passwd-s3fs file

Enter your credentials in a file `~/.passwd-s3fs` and set
owner-only permissions:

```
echo ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY >  ~/.passwd-s3fs
chmod 600  ~/.passwd-s3fs
```

Run s3fs with an existing bucket `mybucket` and directory `/path/to/mountpoint`:

```
s3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs
```

If you encounter any errors, enable debug output:

```
s3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs -o dbglevel=info -f -o curldbg
```

You can also mount on boot by entering the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```
s3fs#mybucket /path/to/mountpoint fuse _netdev,allow_other 0 0
```

or

```
mybucket /path/to/mountpoint fuse.s3fs _netdev,allow_other 0 0
```

If you use s3fs with a non-Amazon S3 implementation, specify the URL and path-style requests:

```
s3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs -o url=http://url.to.s3/ -o use_path_request_style
```

or(fstab)
```
s3fs#mybucket /path/to/mountpoint fuse _netdev,allow_other,use_path_request_style,url=http://url.to.s3/ 0 0
```

To use IBM IAM Authentication, use the `-o ibm_iam_auth` option, and specify the Service Instance ID and API Key in your credentials file:
```
echo SERVICEINSTANCEID:APIKEY > /path/to/passwd
```
The Service Instance ID is only required when using the `-o create_bucket` option.

Note: You may also want to create the global credential file first

```
echo ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY > /etc/passwd-s3fs
chmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs
```

Note2: You may also need to make sure `netfs` service is start on boot


Limitations
-----------

Generally S3 cannot offer the same performance or semantics as a local file system.  More specifically:

* random writes or appends to files require rewriting the entire file
* metadata operations such as listing directories have poor performance due to network latency
* [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) can temporarily yield stale data([Amazon S3 Data Consistency Model](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel))
* no atomic renames of files or directories
* no coordination between multiple clients mounting the same bucket
* no hard links

* [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) - similar to s3fs but has better performance and less POSIX compatibility
* [s3backer](https://github.com/archiecobbs/s3backer) - mount an S3 bucket as a single file
* [S3Proxy](https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy) - combine with s3fs to mount Backblaze B2, EMC Atmos, Microsoft Azure, and OpenStack Swift buckets
* [s3ql](https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/) - similar to s3fs but uses its own object format
* [YAS3FS](https://github.com/danilop/yas3fs) - similar to s3fs but uses SNS to allow multiple clients to mount a bucket
